If you just log in without creating an account or log in with incorrect information, the error message "Error on login" will be displayed:
![error_on_login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74472657/104363361-5a254c00-5515-11eb-982e-76c81cedaa1e.png)


That means you should register first. Once you have registered, the following notification will be displayed: "Your account has been created":
![account_created](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74472657/104363969-3c0c1b80-5516-11eb-82f6-39912cc1449b.png)


As you can see the data will be stored in the local storage:

The log in page appears again so that you can now log in with the registered (stored) data. After logging in, the message "You are logged in" pops up and the task manager opens:
